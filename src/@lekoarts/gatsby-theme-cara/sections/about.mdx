## About Me

I am a veteran and aspiring full stack developer from Southern California now currently residing in Texas with my husband. We both enjoy streaming and building tools for content creators as well as supporting them in their endeavors. I am a pizza lover and linux enthusiast running Fedora 33 as my daily driver with a MacOS VM for additional developer support.
